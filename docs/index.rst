Blast is a public web application built to find a transient's host
galaxy, identify the available archival data, and measure the resulting
host galaxy star formation rates, masses, and stellar ages - for every
new transient reported to the IAU in real-time after the transient is
announced. This information is not provided by any existing transient
broker service.

Blast is developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/scimma/blast>`_.

If you have a problem or need help using the Blast service at https://blast.scimma.org and cannot find an answer here or in the `GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/scimma/blast/discussions>`_, please `ðŸ“§ email our support team <mailto:support@scimma.org?subject=Blast%20support%20request&body=
